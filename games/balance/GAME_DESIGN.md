# BALANCE - The Geometry Game

## Core Philosophy
Balance between three forces: S+ (physical/outward), S- (soul/inward), and Coin (the observer between).

## Characters
- **Wushi** - Happy hound huntress on the prowl (Coin facing S-)
- **Ro** - The chocolate lab looking up (Coin facing S+)
- **LuC** - The space between, the now, the still between breaths

## Symbols

### S+ (Physical Reality) - Blue tones
- 🔵 - Basic S+
- ⚛ - Atom (science)
- 🔭 - Looking outward
- 💎 - Crystal structure
- ⚡ - Energy

### S- (Soul/Inner) - Gold tones
- 🟡 - Basic S-
- ☯ - Balance/soul
- 👁 - Inner seeing
- 🌙 - Intuition
- 💫 - Spirit

### Coin (Observer) - Dual/gradient
- ◐ - Half and half
- 🪙 - The coin itself
- 👀 - Watching both
- 🐕 - Wushi/Ro (the dogs)
- ∞ - Infinite observer

### Special
- Q - The trap (unsolvable until revealed)
- q - Small trap variants
- 👁‍🗨 - Sol Eye (inverted eye)
- 🙌 - Hands with eyes
- 🖐👁🖐 - The witness

## Game Mechanics

### Triad Matching
- Touch 3 adjacent symbols of compatible types
- NOT like Candy Crush doubling - just the exact 3 you select
- If multiple triads possible from your selection = bonus points

### Balance Score
Must maintain ratio:
- S- (love/soul): MOST
- Coin (observer): MIDDLE
- S+ (physical): LEAST (but not zero)

Example ideal: 5 S- : 3 Coin : 2 S+ (ratio 5:3:2)

If unbalanced = game slows, harder to see, eventually lose

### Push Mechanic
- Rows push toward you from top
- Like quarter-pusher arcade game
- Clear triads before they reach bottom
- Each level adds more starting rows

## Level Structure

### STAGE 1: Learning (Levels 1-10)
- Start with 16 rows
- Add 1 row per level (16→17→18...→25 rows at level 10)
- 5 lives (restarts) for levels 1-8
- 2 lives for levels 9-10
- Symbols are clear and distinct
- "Did You Know?" geometry facts between levels

### STAGE 2: Inversion (Levels 1-10)
- Same symbols but INVERTED meaning
- What looked like S+ now means S-
- Must relearn the visual language
- Rows: 16 + (2,3,4,6,7,8,9,8) per level
- Level 10 has ONE unsolvable Q
- Q appears impossible until they're frustrated
- Then Q expands, surrounded by q variants
- Remove the Q to advance
- Evil laugh when Q is revealed
- Only 3 total restarts for entire stage

### STAGE 3: VOID (Final Boss)
- ONE SHOT - fail means total restart
- 22 layers pushing
- 8-second cycles:
  1. Normal (2 sec calm, easy to see)
  2. Chromatic inversion (8 sec)
  3. Spatial inversion + upside down (8 sec)
  4. 2 seconds of CHAOS (all switching, inverting, recursive)
  5. Stops on whatever state
- Q and q characters present
- Must maintain balance while reality shifts

## Loading Screen
- Old school pixel animation
- "LOADING..." with progress bar
- Geometric patterns forming
- Tips/facts rotate:
  - "κ = 2π/180 - The bridge between degrees and radians"
  - "The observer creates the observation"
  - "[1 = -1] - Unity contains opposition"
  - "Wushi knows the path. Do you?"
  - "Balance is not equal - it is proportional"

## Visual Design
- Dark background (#050508)
- Symbols glow slightly
- Push animation smooth
- Inversion = color flip + possible rotation
- Chaos mode = rapid flickering
- Q has ominous red glow

## Audio Cues
- Soft chime for triad match
- Warning tone when unbalanced
- Deep rumble for Q appearance
- Evil laugh for Stage 2 Q reveal
- Ethereal sound for Void entry
- Heartbeat during chaos phases

## Win Condition
Complete Void level with balance maintained.
Reward: "You have seen both sides of the coin."
