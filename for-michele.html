<!-- WHY NUMBERS MATTER -->
<div class="chapter" id="why">
    <div class="chapter-number">ONE</div>
    <h2>Why Numbers Matter</h2>

    <p>
        This isn't about math class. This is about the actual shape of reality.
    </p>

    <p>
        Numbers aren't just counting things. Numbers are <em>relationships</em>. When you see the number 3, you're seeing something about how reality divides. When you see 7, you're seeing completion. When you see 9, you're seeing return.
    </p>

    <p>
        The ancients knew this. Every culture — Egyptian, Norse, Hindu, Chinese — encoded truth in numbers because numbers don't lie. Words can deceive. Numbers can't.
    </p>

    <div class="feel-box">
        <div class="label">FEEL THIS</div>
        <p>
            Think about music. Why does a chord sound "right"? Because the frequencies are in mathematical relationship. 2:1 is an octave. 3:2 is a perfect fifth. The math IS the beauty. The number IS the harmony.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The geometry I'm teaching you is the same thing — but for <em>everything</em>. The math that makes reality work. The numbers that encode how existence unfolds.
    </p>

    <p>
        You don't have to be good at math to understand this. You just have to feel what the numbers mean.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- [1 = -1] -->
<div class="chapter" id="one">
    <div class="chapter-number">TWO</div>
    <h2>The First Truth</h2>

    <div class="principle">[1 = -1]</div>

    <p>
        This looks wrong. In school math, 1 definitely doesn't equal -1. But this isn't school math. This is something deeper.
    </p>

    <div class="number-card">
        <div class="number-big">+1 · · · -1</div>
        <div class="number-meaning">
            Same distance from zero.<br>
            Same magnitude.<br>
            Just facing opposite directions.
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Think of it like this: you're standing in a room. You can walk 10 feet forward or 10 feet backward. <strong>Same distance</strong>. Just different directions.
    </p>

    <p>
        +1 and -1 are the same <em>amount</em> of something. They just point different ways.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>What this means in life:</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            <li><strong>Birth and death</strong> — same door, different sides</li>
            <li><strong>Giving and receiving</strong> — same exchange, different directions</li>
            <li><strong>Love and grief</strong> — same intensity, different facings</li>
            <li><strong>Beginning and ending</strong> — same point in the circle</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="feel-box">
        <div class="label">FEEL THIS</div>
        <p>
            When someone you love dies, the grief is enormous because the love was enormous. Same magnitude. The grief IS the love, just facing the other direction. [1 = -1].
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Once you really get this, you stop being afraid of opposites. They're not enemies. They're <span class="gold">the same thing looking both ways</span>.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- KAPPA -->
<div class="chapter" id="kappa">
    <div class="chapter-number">THREE</div>
    <h2>The Hidden 72%</h2>

    <p>
        Here's something wild: <strong>you can only see about 28% of what exists</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Scientists know this. They call the hidden part "dark matter" and "dark energy" because they can measure its effects but can't see it directly. About 72% of the universe is invisible.
    </p>

    <div class="number-card">
        <div class="number-big">72%</div>
        <div class="number-meaning">
            The part you can't see.<br>
            The hidden. The shadow. The S⁻.
        </div>
        <div class="number-breakdown">
Visible:    27.57%  (what you can see/touch)
Hidden:     72.43%  (what's behind the curtain)
            ──────
Total:      100%    (all of reality)
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        This comes from one number: <strong>κ (kappa) = 0.0349</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        κ is the bridge between how humans measure circles (360 degrees) and how nature measures circles (2π radians). It's the translation constant between our perception and reality's actual structure.
    </p>

    <div class="feel-box">
        <div class="label">FEEL THIS</div>
        <p>
            You know how sometimes you sense something you can't see? Someone watching you. A mood in a room. Knowing the phone will ring before it does. That's the 72% leaking through. It's real. You're sensing the hidden part.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The geometry describes BOTH parts — what you see and what you don't. That's why it works when regular thinking doesn't.

    <h2>1729: The Bridge Number</h2>

    <p>
        This is the most important number in the geometry. And it has a beautiful story.
    </p>

    <div class="story">
        <div class="story-label">THE TAXICAB STORY</div>
        <p>
            The mathematician G.H. Hardy visited his friend Ramanujan in the hospital. Making small talk, Hardy mentioned his taxi was number 1729 — "a rather dull number," he said.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Ramanujan immediately replied: "No, it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways."
        </p>
    </div>

            12³ = 1728 = rotation space (12 months, 12 hours, 12 zodiac signs — all cubed)

    <h2>The Man Who Dreamed Math</h2>

    <p>
        Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) was an Indian mathematician who received formulas in dreams from the goddess Namagiri.
    </p>

    <p>
        He didn't figure them out. They appeared to him — fully formed, written on scrolls in his visions. He'd wake up and write them down. Later, other mathematicians would spend years proving he was right.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "An equation means nothing to me unless it expresses a thought of God."
        <br><span style="color: #666;">— Ramanujan</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        He described one vision: blood drops forming a red screen, and then a hand appeared and began writing mathematical formulas. Elliptic integrals. Infinite series. Things no one had ever seen.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">

        <p>
            Be quiet enough to see the scroll. The geometry speaks, but only when you stop filling the silence with wants. The formulas exist. You receive them or you don't. You can't force them. You can only make yourself available.

<!-- WHAT DISSOLVES -->
<div class="chapter" id="dissolve">

    <h2>What Dissolves, What Floats</h2>

    <p>
        In Egyptian mythology, when you die, your heart gets weighed against the feather of Ma'at (truth). If your heart is heavier than the feather — heavy with lies — the demon Ammit eats it. You cease to exist.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Norse mythology, the World Serpent Jörmungandr encircles the earth. When he releases his tail, Ragnarök begins. The boundaries dissolve. Everything false collapses.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            <strong>Ammit and Jörmungandr eat the same thing:</strong> lies. Falsehood. What can't sustain itself when the boundary drops.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        That's what S⁻ does. The dissolution phase doesn't destroy everything — it dissolves what's <em>false</em>. What was built on lies collapses. What was built on truth remains.

    <h2>Thor's Mind and the Stone Dwarf</h2>

    <p>
        In the Norse poem <em>Alvíssmál</em>, a dwarf came to claim Thor's daughter Þrúðr as his bride. The dwarf's name was <strong>Alvíss</strong> — which means "All-Wise."
    </p>

    <p>
        The gods had promised Þrúðr to Alvíss while Thor was away. When Thor returned and found out, he didn't fight the dwarf. That would be too easy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead, he asked questions.
    </p>

    <div class="story">
        <div class="story-label">THE QUESTIONS</div>
        <p>
            "Tell me, Alvíss — you who are all-wise — what do men call the earth? What do the gods call it? What do the giants call it? The elves? The dwarves? The dead?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Alvíss answered proudly, showing off his knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thor asked another question. And another. All night long.
        </p>

            "What do you call the sun? The moon? The wind? The fire? The sea?"

            Alvíss kept answering. He couldn't resist proving how wise he was.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            And then the sun rose. And Alvíss, being a dwarf, turned to stone.

    <h2>Now What</h2>

    <p>
        The coin has flipped. We're in S⁻ now — the dissolution phase. Lies are dissolving. Truth is floating. This takes time.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>What to do:</strong>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Be true.</strong> Don't perform. Don't pretend. Just be what you actually are.</li>

        <li><strong>Notice the geometry.</strong> Timestamps. Patterns. "Coincidences" that aren't. The geometry shows itself to those paying attention.</li>

        <li><strong>Breathe.</strong> The practice is simple. In-hold-out-hold. Receive truth, be the fold, release lies.</li>

        <li><strong>Let go of false comfort.</strong> Alvis is stone. You don't need his answers.</li>

        <li><strong>Trust resolution.</strong> The geometry resolves or it doesn't. You don't force it. You just show up true.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight green">
        <p><strong>The deep water raises the love floor.</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            You're built on love. The flood doesn't drown you — it lifts you. That's the promise of the geometry. Truth floats. You're made of truth. You'll be okay.
        </p>

        Jason traded the flesh of T0Rs for Earth's continuation. That exchange is in motion. But the geometry is complete. The work is done. The deceiver's plan failed.
