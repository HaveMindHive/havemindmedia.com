## PART I: THE DOCTRINE OF FORMS

### Primary Quotes

> "The lowest form is angular; the next the circular; after this the spiral; next the vortex; and the highest natural form is the perpetually vortical which has a center in every point."
> — *The Fibre* (1740)

> "The origin of forms is not from the most simple, but from the most highly complex."
> — *The Fibre*

> "Angular forms are the basis of all natural forms. They arise first, and from them proceed circular, spiral, and vortical forms in succession."
> — *Oeconomia Regni Animalis*

> "Forms are more complex the higher they are. The celestial form, which has its center in every point, is of infinite complexity, yet appears as the most perfect simplicity."
> — *The Fibre*

SWEDENBORG'S FORM HIERARCHY          κ-FRAMEWORK EQUIVALENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ANGULAR (Lowest)                     τ₁ - First torsion
  "Static, crystalline"                "Static facing (+x, +y)"
  First emergence from point           Scalar position ~36

CIRCULAR                             τ₂ - Second torsion
  "Perpetually angular"                "Mirror rotation (-x, +y)"
  Complete rotation                    Scalar position ~72

SPIRAL                               τ₃ - Third torsion
  "Perpetual circle"                   "Recursive spiral (+x, -y)"
  Helical progression                  Scalar position ~108

VORTICAL                             τ₄ - Silent fourth
  "Perpetual spiral"                   "Silent vortex (-x, -y)"

### The Mathematical Point

> "The first mental representation, 'the point', is not a material thing, but a representation which should allow into itself all the noticeable complexity of Nature: a subject of application of the forces of the Universe."
> — *Principia* (1734)

> "The point is not extension, but pure conatus—the urge to motion without yet being in motion."
> — *Principia*

> "From one mathematical point proceeds the entire universe. It contains all forms in potentia."
> — *De Infinito*

**Framework Equivalent:** The mathematical point IS κ = 2π/180. From this single constant, everything derives.

### Spiral Motion

> "The points move in a spiral motion to form bubbles or globules, which then become the basis of all matter."
> — *Principia*

> "All motion in nature is fundamentally spiral. Even apparently linear motion is spiral motion whose radius is infinite."
> — *Principia*

> "Matter consists of particles that are indefinitely divisible, and these particles are in constant vortical motion."
> — Scientific summary

**Framework Equivalent:**
- 180 steps × κ per step = 2π = full helix turn
- The tetrahelix structure IS Swedenborg's spiral-vortical motion

## PART II: THE TWO WORLDS AND CORRESPONDENCE

### Primary Quotes

> "There are two worlds, the spiritual and the natural. The spiritual world does not draw anything from the natural, nor the natural world from the spiritual. The two are totally distinct, and communicate only by correspondences."
> — *Divine Love and Wisdom*

> "The spiritual world is within the natural world, not as one box is within another, but as the man is within his body."
> — *Doctrine of Correspondence*

> "Everything in the material world is an effect. The causes of all effects lie in the spiritual world."
> — *Arcana Coelestia*

> "Nothing can exist anywhere in the material world that does not have a correspondence with the spiritual world—because if it did, it would have no cause that would make it come into being."
> — *Arcana Coelestia* #5711

> "Correspondence is the relation of cause to effect. The spiritual can clothe itself with the natural, and by influx fill and actuate it."
> — *Doctrine of Correspondence*

### Framework Mapping

SWEDENBORG                           κ-FRAMEWORK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Spiritual World                      S⁺ (manifest, outward)
Natural World                        S⁻ (hidden, inward)

### The Four Transforms as Correspondence

Every natural thing CORRESPONDS to a spiritual cause because it IS that spiritual thing viewed through a different transform:

| Transform | Swedenborg | Framework |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| T₁ (Facing) | Direct spiritual perception | (x, y) |
| T₂ (Mirror) | Natural reflection | (-x, y) |
| T₃ (Recursive) | Spiritual seeing natural | (x, -y) |
| T₄ (Silent) | Natural seeing spiritual | (-x, -y) |

### Master Correspondence Table

> "In heaven there are correspondences of all things with all things of the human body."
> — *Heaven and Hell*

| Spiritual | Natural | Transform | Relation |
|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Divine Love | Heat | T₁ | Direct emanation |
| Divine Wisdom | Light | T₂ | Mirror of love |
| Spiritual Sun | Natural Sun | T₃ | Living/Dead |
| Heaven | Earth | T₄ | Silent correspondence |
| Love (S⁺) | Heat | T₁ | Outward flow |
| Wisdom (S⁻) | Light | T₂ | Inward comprehension |
| Life Force | Fire | T₁ | Torsion manifest |
| Remainder | Ash | T₄ | Silent fourth residue |
| Truth | Water | T₂ | Flowing medium |
| Good | Earth | T₁ | Stable base |
| Love (Center) | Heart | T₁ | S⁺ pump |
| Understanding | Lungs | T₂ | S⁻ exchange |
| Source (Ω₀) | Sun | T₁ | Living center |
| Reflected truth | Moon | T₂ | P reflection (27.57%) |
| Individual souls | Stars | T₃ | s-nodes |

## PART III: DISCRETE DEGREES AND INFLUX

### Primary Quotes

> "Degrees are of a two-fold kind: degrees of height (discrete degrees) and degrees of breadth (continuous degrees). Degrees of height are homogeneous, and one is from the other in succession, like end, cause, and effect."
> — *Divine Love and Wisdom*

> "There are three degrees in the spiritual world and three degrees in the natural world, according to which all influx takes place."
> — *Interaction of Soul and Body*

> "The thought does not shade off into the speech. The thought descends into the speech and clothes itself."
> — *Divine Love and Wisdom*

> "Order is that the celestial shall flow into the spiritual and adapt it to itself; that the spiritual shall flow into the rational, and adapt it to itself; and so the rational into the knowing and adapt it to itself."
> — *Compendium*

> "There is one only Life which flows into and vivifies all Forms. To this life forms which are substances correspond; which by continual Divine influx are vivified in such wise that to themselves they appear to live from themselves."
> — *Arcana Coelestia* #3484

### The Three Degrees

| Degree | Name | Essence | Role | Framework |
|--------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| 1 (Highest) | Celestial | Love | End | D₁₀ [1=-1] |
| 2 (Middle) | Spiritual | Wisdom | Cause | D₈ (Ω) |
| 3 (Lowest) | Natural | Use | Effect | D₆/D₇ (S⁺/S⁻) |

### Influx Mechanics

```
INFLUX = TORSION FLOW

Source (Ω₀)
    ↓
    τ (torsion)
    ↓
Celestial degree (D₁₀)     Energy: 1.000000
    ↓
    τ × (59/60)
    ↓
Spiritual degree (D₈)      Energy: 0.983333
    ↓
    τ × (59/60)²
    ↓
Natural degree (D₆/D₇)     Energy: 0.966944
```

**The 59/60 decay IS Swedenborg's "adaptation" at each degree.**

### The Law of Discrete Degrees

> "Discrete degrees are entirely different from continuous degrees. Continuous degrees are like the gradations of light to shade, of heat to cold, or of hardness to softness. But discrete degrees are entirely distinct, like prior and posterior, cause and effect, or producing and produced."
> — *Divine Love and Wisdom*

Framework Translation:
- Scalar positions are discrete, not continuous
- S⁺ and S⁻ do not merge—they correspond
- Torsion flows from source (Ω₀) outward
- Energy decays by 59/60 per step

---

## PART IV: THE DUAL SUN

### Primary Quotes

> "Divine Love and Divine Wisdom appear in the spiritual world as a Sun."
> — *Divine Love and Wisdom* #83

> "The sun of the spiritual world is not God, but is a proceeding from the Divine Love and Divine Wisdom of God-Man."
> — *Divine Love and Wisdom* #93

> "Out of the sun that takes form from the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom, heat and light go forth."
> — *Divine Love and Wisdom* #89

> "Spiritual heat and light, in proceeding from the Lord as a sun, make one, just as his Divine Love and Divine Wisdom make one."
> — *Divine Love and Wisdom* #99

> "It is very necessary to be known that there are two suns, one spiritual, the other natural; a spiritual sun for those who are in the spiritual world, and a natural sun for those who are in the natural world."
> — *Divine Love and Wisdom*

> **"WITHOUT A DOUBLE SUN, ONE LIVING AND THE OTHER DEAD, NO CREATION IS POSSIBLE."**
> — *Divine Love and Wisdom*

> "The sun of nature is pure fire, from which all life has been withdrawn."
> — *Divine Love and Wisdom*

### Framework Mapping

```
DUAL SUN COSMOLOGY

SPIRITUAL SUN (Living)              NATURAL SUN (Dead)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Source: Divine Love/Wisdom          Source: Fire (derived)
Emanates: Heat + Light as ONE       Emanates: Heat, Light separate
Nature: S⁺ ⊗ S⁻ unified            Nature: S⁺/S⁻ already split
Position: s = 0 (crossroads)        Position: s > 0 (manifest)
Framework: Ω₀                       Framework: Projection
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Heat and Light as One

> "Before the split, at the spiritual sun: Heat IS Light, Love IS Wisdom, S⁺ IS S⁻. This is the [1 = -1] identity in its purest form."

At s = 0 (crossroads):
- Heat = 1.0, Light = 1.0, Unity = 1.0
- No separation
- Pre-split state

At s > 0 (after split):
- Heat ≠ Light
- Observable fraction: P = 27.57%
- Shadow fraction: 1-P = 72.43%

## PART V: EQUILIBRIUM AND FREEDOM

### Primary Quotes

> "The equilibrium between heaven and hell is an equilibrium between the good that is from heaven and the evil that is from hell, thus it is a spiritual equilibrium, which in its essence is freedom."
> — *Heaven and Hell* #597

> "From hell falsity from evil continually exhales, and from heaven truth from good. It is this spiritual equilibrium that causes man to think and will in freedom."
> — *Heaven and Hell* #537

> "When he is in that equilibrium he is in freedom either to admit or accept evil and its falsity from hell or to admit or accept good and its truth from heaven."
> — *Heaven and Hell* #537

> "Man is kept by the Lord between heaven and hell, and thus in equilibrium, that he may be in freedom for the sake of reformation."
> — *Heaven and Hell* #601

> "Nothing exists without a relationship to its opposite. The opposite enables us to know its actual nature and level."
> — *Divine Love and Wisdom*

### Framework Mapping

**Equilibrium = [1 = -1]**

```
         HEAVEN (S⁺)
            ↓
      good / truth
            ↓
    ←—— HUMAN (s=0) ——→
            ↑
      evil / falsity
            ↑
         HELL (S⁻)
```

At s = 0, τ₄ facing is undetermined (= 0). The observer CHOOSES:
- τ₄ facing = +1 → tilts toward S⁺ (heaven)
- τ₄ facing = -1 → tilts toward S⁻ (hell)
- τ₄ facing = 0 → perfect equilibrium (freedom)

**This is why freedom exists:** At s=0, neither heaven nor hell dominates. The forces are perfectly balanced.

## PART VI: THE UNIVERSAL HUMAN (MAXIMUS HOMO)

### Primary Quotes

> "Heaven, taken in a single all-inclusive grasp, reflects a single individual. Angels know this and refer to heaven as the Universal Human."
> — *Heaven and Hell*

> "All the angelic societies form a single unit that is the Universal Human. Each society performs a function that corresponds to an organ in the human body."
> — Swedenborg Foundation

> "God is Man. An Eternal Mind is an eternal Man."
> — *True Christian Religion*

> "Nothing proceeds out of anything except it first be in it; and the spiritual and natural worlds conspiring to the human form can only proceed from a God who is Absolute Man."
> — *Doctrine of Correspondence*

> "The whole angelic heaven in its aggregate represents a single man, and before the Lord appears as a single man."
> — *Heaven and Hell*

### Body-Dimension Mapping

| Body Part | Heavenly Society | Framework | Function |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| Head/Brain | Celestial heaven | D₁₀ [1=-1] | Pure consciousness |
| Heart | Celestial kingdom | D₈ (Ω) | S⁺ pump, love circulating |
| Lungs | Spiritual kingdom | D₈ (Ω) | S⁻ exchange, wisdom |
| Right side | Relates to good | D₇ (S⁺) | Active, outward |
| Left side | Relates to truth | D₆ (S⁻) | Receptive, inward |
| Blood | Love of truth | Torsion | Life force carrier |
| Nerves | Truth from good | Correspondence | Communication |
| Chest | Middle heaven | D₈ | Love-Wisdom integration |
| Abdomen | Natural heaven | D₆/D₇ | Processing, transform |
| Limbs | Outmost parts | D₄/D₅ | Action in world |

### Why Human Form?

The 10D structure IS human form because:
1. **Bilateral symmetry** from T₁ + T₂ + T₃ + T₄ = (0,0)
2. **Vertical stratification** from discrete degrees
3. **Circulatory patterns** from torsion flow
4. **Organ differentiation** from correspondence

## PART VII: THE FIVE CHURCHES

### Swedenborg's Spiritual History

| Church | Period | State | Framework |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Most Ancient | Pre-flood | Direct celestial perception | Near s=0 |
| Ancient | Post-flood to Abraham | Correspondence knowledge | s = moderate |
| Israelitish | Abraham to Christ | Representative/External | s = increasing |
| Christian | Christ to 1757 | Faith declining | s approaching fold |
| New Church | 1757 onward | Spiritual sense restored | s returning toward 0 |

> "The most ancient people who lived before the flood had inward peace, and at the same time outward peace, and from this heaven among men."
> — *New Jerusalem* #255

> "The ancient writers knew about this period and called it the Golden Age or the reign of Saturn."
> — *Earths in the Universe* #49

### The 1757 Transition

> "The Last Judgment has been accomplished... in the spiritual world."
> — *Last Judgment* (1758)

Framework Interpretation: 1757 represents a fold point crossing—a phase transition where old equilibrium collapsed and new configuration became possible.

---

## PART VIII: KEY NUMBERS IN SWEDENBORG

### The Number 12

*Arcana Coelestia* is **12 volumes**:
- 12 = 360/30 = circle/κ
- 12 = zodiac signs = observer divisions
- 12 = hours = temporal partition
- 12 = 2² × 3 = coin-squared × triad

### The Number 7

> "When anything extremely holy or positively sacrosanct was expressed, the words 'seventy times seven' were used."
> — *Arcana Coelestia* #433

7 = 3 + 4 = Triad + Transforms = Complete spiritual operation

### The Number 60

- Base-60 appears throughout Swedenborg's cosmology
- 60 = 2² × 3 × 5 = complete state base
- Contains all three structural primes

---

## APPENDIX A: SWEDENBORG QUOTE COLLECTION

### On the Nature of Reality

> "The spiritual can clothe itself with the natural, and by influx fill and actuate it."

> "Life flows in from God through angels, and angels through spirits, to humans."

> "The dead serves as a plane for the living to rest upon."

### On Perception and Knowledge

> "Man sees from his interior man the things that are in the exterior man as from the middle of a garden he sees what is around him."

> "To see the truth we have in us needs only to be excited or vivified."

### On Love and Wisdom

> "All things of love are called celestial, and all things of wisdom are called spiritual."

> "Love is the life of man. Wisdom is the form of that life."

### On Correspondence

> "There is a correspondence of all things of heaven with all things of man."

> "The whole natural world corresponds to the spiritual world."

### On Creation

> "The end of creation is that all things may return to the Creator."

> "Creation is a perpetual proceeding from first to last."

## PART IX: PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

### Example 1: The Fire Correspondence

**Swedenborg's Statement:**
> "Fire corresponds to love, because both warm and illuminate."
> — *Arcana Coelestia*

**Framework Demonstration:**

```python
# In the framework, Fire is S+ (manifest energy)
# Love is the source that creates fire's pattern

from core.constants import PROJECTION_FACTOR, SHADOW_FRACTION

# At s = 0 (spiritual sun), love IS fire undifferentiated
love_at_source = 1.0  # Full unity

# At s > 0 (natural world), fire appears as projection
fire_manifest = love_at_source * PROJECTION_FACTOR  # 0.2757...
fire_hidden = love_at_source * SHADOW_FRACTION      # 0.7243...

# The "warmth" you feel is the 27.57% that projects
# The "love behind it" is the 72.43% you sense but don't see

print(f"Visible fire (warmth): {fire_manifest:.4f}")
print(f"Hidden source (love): {fire_hidden:.4f}")
print(f"Total (correspondence): {fire_manifest + fire_hidden:.4f}")
# Output: Total = 1.0 (correspondence preserved)
```

**What This Means:**
When Swedenborg says fire "corresponds" to love, he means:
- Fire IS love viewed through the T₁ transform
- 27.57% manifests as physical heat
- 72.43% remains as the felt but unseen source
- The total is always 1.0 (conservation through correspondence)

---

### Example 2: Heart and Lungs as S⁺/S⁻

**Swedenborg's Statement:**
> "The heart corresponds to love, and the lungs correspond to wisdom. These two make one, just as love and wisdom make one in the Lord."
> — *Divine Love and Wisdom*

**Framework Demonstration:**

```python
# Heart = S+ (outward pumping, active emission)
# Lungs = S- (inward reception, gas exchange)

class HeartLungSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heart_phase = 0  # S+ position
        self.lung_phase = 0   # S- position

    def heartbeat(self, kappa=0.0349066):
        """Heart pumps outward - S+ action"""
        self.heart_phase += kappa
        return ("SYSTOLE", +1)  # Outward, positive

    def breath(self, kappa=0.0349066):
        """Lungs draw inward - S- action"""
        self.lung_phase += kappa
        return ("INHALE", -1)  # Inward, negative

    def unity_check(self):
        """They make one - [1 = -1]"""
        # Heart's +1 and Lung's -1 sum to equilibrium
        return self.heart_phase - self.lung_phase

# After 180 heartbeats, heart completes one cycle
# After 180 breaths, lungs complete one cycle
# They synchronize at s = 0 (unity)

system = HeartLungSystem()
for _ in range(180):
    system.heartbeat()
    system.breath()

print(f"Heart-Lung difference: {system.unity_check():.10f}")
# Output: 0.0 (perfect balance - they make ONE)
```

**What This Means:**
The human body embodies [1 = -1]:
- Heart = active principle (+1)
- Lungs = receptive principle (-1)
- Together = 0 (equilibrium = life)
- This is why you die if either stops—the balance breaks

---

### Example 3: The Three Degrees in Practice

**Swedenborg's Statement:**
> "There are three degrees of height: the celestial, the spiritual, and the natural. The celestial degree is opened first in man; then the spiritual; and lastly the natural."
> — *Divine Love and Wisdom*

**Framework Demonstration:**

```python
from core.constants import ACTIVE_RATIO  # 59/60

def influx_through_degrees(source_energy=1.0):
    """
    Energy flows from celestial through spiritual to natural.
    At each degree boundary, 1/60 is lost to "adaptation."
    """

    # CELESTIAL (D₁₀) - Direct perception of [1 = -1]
    celestial = source_energy
    print(f"Celestial degree: {celestial:.6f}")
    print("  -> Direct union with source, no loss")

    # SPIRITUAL (D₈) - Wisdom perceives through medium
    spiritual = celestial * ACTIVE_RATIO  # 59/60
    loss_1 = celestial - spiritual
    print(f"Spiritual degree: {spiritual:.6f} (lost: {loss_1:.6f})")
    print("  -> 'Wisdom clothes itself in understanding'")

    # NATURAL (D₆/D₇) - Physical manifestation
    natural = spiritual * ACTIVE_RATIO  # (59/60)²
    loss_2 = spiritual - natural
    print(f"Natural degree: {natural:.6f} (lost: {loss_2:.6f})")
    print("  -> 'Understanding clothes itself in knowledge'")

    # Total transmission efficiency
    total_loss = celestial - natural
    efficiency = natural / celestial
    print(f"\nTotal transmission: {efficiency*100:.2f}%")
    print(f"Total loss: {total_loss*100:.2f}%")

    return celestial, spiritual, natural

c, s, n = influx_through_degrees()
# Output:
# Celestial degree: 1.000000
#   -> Direct union with source, no loss
# Spiritual degree: 0.983333 (lost: 0.016667)
#   -> 'Wisdom clothes itself in understanding'
# Natural degree: 0.966944 (lost: 0.016389)
#   -> 'Understanding clothes itself in knowledge'
#
# Total transmission: 96.69%
# Total loss: 3.31%
```

**What This Means:**
When Swedenborg says "influx adapts itself," he means:
- Original energy (1.0) flows from source
- Each degree transition loses 1/60 (1.67%)
- After three degrees: 96.69% remains
- The 3.31% "lost" isn't destroyed—it's the "medium" that makes transmission possible

### Example 4: Correspondence in Daily Objects

**Swedenborg's Master Principle:**
> "Nothing exists in the natural world that does not have a correspondence with something in the spiritual world."
> — *Arcana Coelestia*

**Complete Correspondence Table with Framework:**

  τ₂ (spiritual): -0.30
  τ₃ (natural):   +0.20
  τ₄ (choice):    -0.80 (base: -0.40, facing: -0.40)

```

**What This Means:**
- At equilibrium (sum = 0), there is maximum freedom
- Any choice creates an imbalance
- The universe responds to restore balance
- This IS why consequences follow choices

### Example 6: The Form Progression

**Swedenborg's Statement:**
> "The lowest form is angular; the next the circular; after this the spiral; next the vortex; and the highest natural form is the perpetually vortical."
> — *The Fibre*

**Framework Demonstration:**

```python
import math

def demonstrate_form_progression():
    """
    Show how forms evolve from angular to celestial.
    """

    # ANGULAR: Single point, fixed position
    print("1. ANGULAR FORM (τ₁)")
    angular = (1, 0)  # Fixed point
    print(f"   Position: {angular}")
    print("   Character: Static, crystalline, first emergence")

    print()

    # SPIRAL: Rotation + radial growth
    print("3. SPIRAL FORM (τ₃)")
    spiral_points = []
    for step in range(0, 181, 60):
        angle = step * kappa

    print()

    # VORTICAL: 3D spiral with depth
    print("4. VORTICAL FORM (τ₄)")
    print("   x = r·cos(θ), y = r·sin(θ), z = θ/2π")
    vortex_points = []
    for step in range(0, 181, 60):
        angle = step * kappa
        r = 1.0
        z = angle / (2 * math.pi)  # Depth

    print()
    print("   At celestial form, τ₁ + τ₂ + τ₃ + τ₄ = 0")
    print("   All forms unified, no separation")

demonstrate_form_progression()
```

**What This Means:**
- Angular is the first differentiation from the point
- Each form IS the previous form in continuous motion
- Celestial form has "center in every point" because at Ω₀, all positions are s=0
- The framework's 180 steps complete one turn through all forms

### Example 7: The Dual Sun in Practice

**Swedenborg's Statement:**
> "Without a double sun, one living and the other dead, no creation is possible."
> — *Divine Love and Wisdom*

**Framework Demonstration:**

def dual_sun_system(scalar_position: float):
    """
    Calculate heat/light split from spiritual and natural suns.

    At s=0 (spiritual sun): Heat = Light (unified)
    At s>0 (natural sun view): Heat ≠ Light (split)
    """

    import math
    P = math.sqrt(3) / (2 * math.pi)  # Projection factor

    if scalar_position == 0:
        # SPIRITUAL SUN (Living)

        heat = P * decay  # Observable heat
        light = (1 - P) * decay  # Observable light
        unity = heat / light if light > 0 else float('inf')

        print(f"  Light (S⁻): {light:.6f}")
        print(f"  Ratio H/L: {unity:.6f}")
        print("  This is why physical sun appears 'dead'")
        print("  Fire without life = S⁺ without S⁻ unity")

    return heat, light, unity

# At spiritual sun
print("=" * 50)
dual_sun_system(0)

# At various distances
print("\n" + "=" * 50)
dual_sun_system(100)

print("\n" + "=" * 50)
dual_sun_system(1000)

print("\n" + "=" * 50)
dual_sun_system(1729)  # The fold point!
```

**What This Means:**
- The "living" sun has heat = light = 1 (unity)
- The "dead" sun has heat ≠ light (split)
- You can't have creation without BOTH
- The spiritual provides the life; the natural provides the form
- At s = 1729 (the fold), something special happens...

**Output:**
```
INFLUX CHAIN
============================================================
Step 0 (Source): 1.0000000000
  ^ This is Ω₀, the Divine, the spiritual sun

Step  1: 0.9833333333
         First angel receives
         (absorbed this step: 0.0166666667)

Step  3: 0.9508379630
         Celestial heaven complete
         (absorbed this step: 0.0161328961)

Step 12: 0.8186488181
         Spiritual heaven complete (12 = zodiac)

         Natural heaven complete (36 = 12×3)
         (absorbed this step: 0.0093168951)

Step 60: 0.3676517819
         One complete influx cycle (60 = base)
         (absorbed this step: 0.0062314709)

============================================================
After 60 steps:
  Remaining energy: 0.3676517819
  Total absorbed: 0.6323482181
  Remaining as fraction: 0.367652 = (59/60)^60
  Verification: (59/60)^60 = 0.3676517819
```

**What This Means:**
- After one complete influx cycle (60 steps), 36.77% remains
- This is remarkably close to 1/e ≈ 0.368 (natural decay constant!)
- The "lost" 63.23% isn't destroyed—it's absorbed by the medium
- Without this absorption, no transmission would be possible
- The medium (angels, heavens) is CREATED by the absorption
