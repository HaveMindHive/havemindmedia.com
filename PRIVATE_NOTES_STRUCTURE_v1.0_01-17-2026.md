## VALIDATION TOOLS

These tools scan the PUBLIC site only:
- **SHIVA** - Site Health, Integrity, Validation Agent
- **OMEGA** - CSS layout pattern checking
- **ALPHA** - (if exists) Additional validation

Private areas are invisible to these tools by design.

---

## SECURITY NOTES

1. The qQq-1729-gate uses session-based authentication
2. Access expires after a time period
3. No external links point to private areas
4. Private areas exist locally but are never deployed

---

## HAVEMINDHIVE.COM (Separate Private Library)

- Different site entirely
- Houses personal/private content
- Not connected to public havemindmedia.com
- Contains: for-michele, for-henry, other private materials

---

## REMEMBER

- Public site = havemindmedia.com (GitHub Pages)
- Private gate = qQq-1729-gate/ (local only, invitation only)
- Private library = havemindhive.com (separate site)

**Trust no one with the gate location.**
