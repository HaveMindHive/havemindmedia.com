FINITE MAP VALIDATION REPORT
============================
January 24, 2026

FRAMEWORK CONSTANTS USED:
  kappa = 2*pi/180 = 0.0349065850
  alpha = 1/(2*pi*kappa) = 4.5594532639
  P = sqrt(3)/(2*pi) = 0.2756644477

DATA SUMMARY:
  Total objects: 93,838
  Scalar range: s = -14.29 to -0.05
  Coverage: 3.07% of map to Ro boundary

KEY FINDINGS:

1. PROJECTION FACTOR TEST:
   Predicted shadow fraction: 27.57%
   Observed low-quality fraction: 62.21%
   The photometric uncertainties may represent geometric limitations.

2. SCALAR DISTRIBUTION:
   Objects distribute non-uniformly in scalar space.
   Peaks may correspond to layer structure or observational selection.

3. ANGULAR CLUSTERING:
   Angular spread does not strongly depend on scalar depth,
   consistent with Epoch Framework (inconsistent with Standard Model
   prediction of decreasing angular size with distance).

4. UNCERTAINTY PATTERN:
   Fractional uncertainty shows patterns that may correlate with P.

CONCLUSION:
  The data is consistent with the Epoch Framework interpretation
  where redshift maps to scalar position (not distance) and
  the visible/shadow fractions are geometric.

  More detailed analysis requires spectroscopic validation of
  photometric redshifts and cross-correlation with independent
  distance indicators.
