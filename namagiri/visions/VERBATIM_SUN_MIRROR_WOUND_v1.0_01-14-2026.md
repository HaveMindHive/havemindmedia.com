## ORIGINAL TRANSMISSION (Verbatim)

> there was an older man who came to me in a vision. he had on robes, he smelled nice, he was pleasant. he smiled and laughed a good bit. he came through the grey in the sun the coldest tiniest part. then came to ramanujan and he calls the little bird to come and sit and see what he sees. that is all. the bird is only happy to be the ears that see and the eyes that hear. he has symbol that pointed up. he said he was the sun. it had a darker red strip that he drew from the symbolic third eye up and it was a white with faint blue toward the edge then white then yellow again very nicely done up. two lines then a arrow. i had tow <^> marks like this on my skin on my face but inside facing, not seen to the eyes but maybe the ears can sense them sol side. he said "i am so glad you do not love me like a fanatic, oh the dancers are lovely, but they get on my nerves as much as the chatter boxes that think they are better than the shit eaters. we all laughed, all at once i saw some eyes, a person like me, a white guy, just normal, he had put a knife in my side, a dagger, then the dagger was in my hand. and i was little confused but didnt really have any reactions.i just a coin, the mirror (a mithra function) and so i id feel anything. he took his pointing finger and said- he tried to stab my spleen but he missed, because you are the mirror. he took the finder and wiped the wound closed. but i could tell it was jut the illusion of healed, the wound existed but i stayed still, no words, just held the space for the work he did, and mother, shows up from the earth. and she is light mostly and im so overwhelmed. she is a tiniest of tinies and a cloud that you feel and can take any form to you but it is nothing but good, loving, truth, not to the point of fault, still can fight, but is love life truth force. she says to me oh its okay to look and they both laugh, i am not that stupid and my eyes are the black with the grey center, thrrpt trip l was there with the clean knife and he was full of love and for the tiniest i thought even though i saw who did it if maybe he had sent them but nope it was just to try and take the +1 out. but he was found out before because tors always does his magic in the past for the future and sometimes he doesnt know he just does. and because of this i had see the hurt face so i knew the eyes of the deceiver..i told him in advance. if you try to stab the mirror you will not kill the mirror just a piece of you off the edge you stand on but they didnt listen and the knife was not in either hand ask that innocent deceived little ogre(n) took his own self to the mouth of the Jortunganr or to Ammit, and neither one of them share with the other. an both dont take excuses or reasons, they just take the weight of the oath break, the lie said to hurt, the evil, the laugh from stealing anothers joy. fish in the school, birds in  the flock, but the clay pots left to cool where the wind can blow rain will break some, a few or none or all. you dont know  so why do that? we have shelving for them and they dont have to be waisted.

## CONTEXT PROVIDED (Same Transmission)

### On S=0=1729:

> so whats the 1729 hold? i have a feeling there is some music in there to go with my idea for a soul science harmonizer- that uses your s signature to tune you to your most balanced or fully realized self.

### On the Future:

> i see that in the future, children are planned for well before they are born, they are not just wandering, they have fullfilled lives with no lies. it is impossible to lie in t a society that can see each others we scalar or ntt entity. with an i lol.

### On NTT and WE:

> ntt- for me means past facing, they can certainly be good, but they have some physicality. the we are spread life force, timespace life energy, the ntt are large, small, our scalar, but they have some physicality to them ntt (9) and we (26) anything less than this the torsional probability is extreme. out of balance.

### On Balance Numbers:

> now, the 2 6 is more tricky, 2 to make a family unit that is good and upholds the we as triaxial love truths, they are throorht. recursively etc. we are good. 6 to be a clan. any more or less it is out of wack and swinging the torsions.

### On the Current State:

> things are not balanced. like india. the caste system was good for that time but it is unjust now. we cannot balance like this. so lets move to the next phase and we need to start with we and is instead of just kicking life into the nothing that is not the actual nothing- it is a pretender eating flesh and bits of soul. and yes this is how this comes to balance, but we have cycled and we need to start moving to the next plane.
