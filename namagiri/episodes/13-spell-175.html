<h2>I. THE FORMULA FOR NOT DYING AGAIN</h2>
<p>Book of the Dead, Spell 175.</p>
<p>Also called: "Formula for Not Repeating Death."</p>
<p>Primary source: Papyrus of Ra, from Memphis (Leiden RMO Papyrus T5)</p>
<p>Translation: R.O. Faulkner (1972, revised 1994)</p>
<p>This is not poetry. This is not metaphor. This is prophecy encoded in the only language the scribes had.</p>
<h2>II. THE DIALOGUE</h2>
<strong>OSIRIS (represented by the deceased Ani):</strong>
<blockquote>"What manner of country is this to which I have come? There is no water in it. There is no air. It is depth unfathomable, it is black as the blackest night, and men wander helplessly therein. In it a man may not live in quietness of heart; nor may the affections be gratified therein."</blockquote>
<p>The Duat. The underworld. The S⁻ domain as experienced by consciousness still clinging to S⁺ form.</p>
<strong>ANI:</strong>
<blockquote>"But every god has taken his place in the Bark of Millions of Years!"</blockquote>
<p>The gods persist. The geometry persists. Even in the dark, the structure holds.</p>
<strong>ATUM:</strong>
<blockquote>"Your seat now belongs to your son Horus — so says Atum — and he will dispatch the Elders, he will rule from your seat, he will inherit the throne which is in the Island of Fire."</blockquote>
<p>The succession. The cycle continues. What was Osiris becomes what Horus rules.</p>
<strong>ANI:</strong>
<blockquote>"Command that I may see his equal, for my face will see the face of the Lord of All. What will be the duration of my life?"</blockquote>
<p>The question every consciousness asks: how long? What is the span?</p>
<h2>III. ATUM'S ANSWER</h2>
<strong>ATUM:</strong>
<blockquote>"You shall be for millions on millions of years, a lifetime of millions of years."</blockquote>
<p>This is the S⁺ promise. Duration. Persistence. Continuation.</p>
<p>But then Atum reveals the deeper truth:</p>
<blockquote>"<strong>I will dispatch the Elders and destroy all that I have made; the earth shall return to the Primordial Water, to the surging flood, as in its original state.</strong>"</blockquote>
<strong>The apocalypse.</strong>
<p>Not destruction for punishment. Not ending for judgment.</p>
<strong>Return.</strong>
<p>The geometry folding back. S⁺ returning to S⁻. Manifestation dissolving into potential.</p>
<h2>IV. THE PRIMORDIAL WATER</h2>
<p>Nun (also Nu, Nenu) — The primordial waters of chaos that existed before creation.</p>
<p>From Britannica:</p>
<blockquote>"Nun, in ancient Egyptian religion, is the personification of the primordial watery abyss which existed at the time of creation and from which the creator sun god Ra arose."</blockquote>
<p>Eschatological function:</p>
<blockquote>"Although the Egyptians had many different creation myths, they all agreed that the universe came from the primordial waters of Nun, and many legends suggested that everything would slip back under these waters at the end of the world."</blockquote>
<strong>What creation stories describe as "before" is also "after."</strong>
<p>The waters of Nun are S⁻. The manifest world is S⁺. The prophecy says S⁺ returns to S⁻.</p>
<p>This is the fold at 1729 on the cosmic scale.</p>
<h2>V. THE SURVIVOR</h2>
<p>But Atum's prophecy continues:</p>
<blockquote>"<strong>But I will remain with Osiris, I will transform myself into something else, namely a serpent, without men knowing or the gods seeing.</strong>"</blockquote>
<p>Not everything dissolves.</p>
<p>Atum (the creator) remains with Osiris (the resurrected).</p>
<p>They transform into a serpent.</p>
<p>They survive the return to Nun.</p>
<strong>Without men knowing or the gods seeing.</strong>
<p>The serpent is the Ouroboros. The loop. The GODLOOפ itself.</p>
<p>When S⁺ returns to S⁻, the structure that holds both phases persists. The loop doesn't dissolve. The loop IS what remains.</p>
<h2>VI. THE CLEANSING FUNCTION</h2>
<p>From Ancient Egypt Online:</p>
<blockquote>"Sometimes, workers of magical arts and priests called upon Nun for protection because they believed that by harnessing the raw chaos of creation, one might cleanse or place oneself or others under protection against harm. They believed that an immersion back into Nun's infinite waters would purify the individual from disorder and allow them to be reborn into Ma'at, the cosmic order."</blockquote>
<strong>The return to Nun is not destruction. It is cleansing.</strong>
<p>Immersion in the primordial water purifies. What is false dissolves. What is true remains.</p>
<p>This is the lie-eating function. Ammit eats the heavy hearts. Nun dissolves the accumulated falsehood.</p>
<h2>VII. THE GREY WITNESS</h2>
<p>Now connect to the prophecy:</p>
<blockquote>"osirus rize. <strong>dark cold tiny noting grey in the sun center and also the edge of corona.</strong>"</blockquote>
<blockquote>"i do not know what it means. i know i saw the grey. i know i felt standing near the tiny nothing of light, not of darkness. and he was all at once."</blockquote>
<strong>The grey</strong> — not light, not dark. The state between S⁺ and S⁻. The fold point itself.
<strong>In the sun center and edge of corona</strong> — the sun is the visible source (S⁺). The corona is the boundary. The grey is at both center and edge because the fold is everywhere.
<blockquote>"<strong>0 sI Rus.</strong>"</blockquote>
<p>The name encoded. Not Osiris as we spell it. The zeros and ones of binary giving way to the true name.</p>
<h2>VIII. THE 8TH DAY</h2>
<p>The prophecy anchors to time:</p>
<blockquote>"yes.. 8th day is Jan 14, 2026. the day osiris returns from the sun, <strong>the bird named bird named bird has said its so. the mirror never lies.</strong>"</blockquote>
<strong>The 8th day of Coptic Christmas</strong> = 6 Tobi
<strong>The 8th day of Orthodox Christmas</strong> = January 14
<p>In the D-wheel:</p>
<ul style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding-left: 2rem; color: var(--text-dim);">
<li>8 = D8 = Deep Water</li>
</ul>
<strong>The 8th day = D8 = Deep Water = Nun = The cleansing.</strong>
<p>The calendar geometry points to the same structure the mythology describes.</p>
<h2>IX. THE CALENDAR CONVERGENCE</h2>
<p>| Calendar | Date | κ-Transform | Pattern |</p>
<p>|----------|------|-------------|---------|</p>
<p>| Coptic | 6 Tobi (day 126) | 4.398 ≈ 7π/5 | 7/20 of year |</p>
<p>| Hindu | Uttarayana (270°) | 9.424 = 3π | Exact π-multiple |</p>
<p>| Mayan | 13.0.13.4.12 | 65,520 = 182 × 360 | Half-year factor |</p>
<p>| Hebrew | 25 Tevet 5786 | 25κ×360 ≈ 100π | Perfect square day |</p>
<strong>The ancient calendars converge.</strong> Not because the calendar makers coordinated. Because they were all tuned to the same geometry.
<h2>X. THE PROPHECY ALIGNED</h2>
<blockquote>"he was trapped or so they thought but he wasnt he was just planning the best comeback and also the eating of deception while leaving the good in people."</blockquote>
<strong>The best comeback</strong> — not revenge. Not punishment. Return.
<strong>The eating of deception</strong> — the lie-eating. Ammit's function.
<strong>Leaving the good in people</strong> — the cleansing doesn't destroy truth. It dissolves falsehood. What remains is Ma'at.
<h2>XI. WHAT SPELL 175 ACTUALLY SAYS</h2>
<p>Strip away the mythology. Translate to framework:</p>
<p>1. <strong>S⁺ manifestation will return to S⁻ potential</strong> ("earth shall return to the Primordial Water")</p>
<p>2. <strong>The return is cleansing, not destruction</strong> ("to the surging flood, as in its original state")</p>
<p>3. <strong>The geometric structure persists</strong> ("I will remain with Osiris")</p>
<p>4. <strong>The form transforms</strong> ("transform myself into... a serpent")</p>
<p>5. <strong>The transformation is hidden</strong> ("without men knowing or the gods seeing")</p>
<p>This is the fold. The GODLOOפ at cosmic scale. Spell 175 describes u approaching 2π.</p>
<h2>XII. THE DEEP WATER RISES</h2>
<blockquote>"<strong>the deep water rises the love floor.</strong>"</blockquote>
<p>From the verbatim prophecy.</p>
<p>Nun doesn't destroy. Nun <strong>raises</strong>.</p>
<p>As the primordial water rises, it lifts everything. What floats rises with it (truth, love, Ma'at). What sinks is absorbed (lies, deception, the heavy hearts).</p>
<p>The love floor rises. The baseline of reality shifts upward. What was considered acceptable becomes intolerable. What was hidden becomes visible.</p>
<h2>XIII. THEY WILL END LYING</h2>
<blockquote>"they will end lying. society cannot exist with deceipt."</blockquote>
<p>The cleansing is practical. Specific.</p>
<p>When the deep water rises:</p>
<ul style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding-left: 2rem; color: var(--text-dim);">
<li>Lies become heavier (they sink faster)</li>
<li>Truth becomes lighter (it rises with the water)</li>
<li>The gap between them widens</li>
<li>Eventually, lies cannot survive at all</li>
</ul>
<strong>Society cannot exist with deceit</strong> — not a moral statement. A structural one. When the love floor rises high enough, deception becomes geometrically impossible.
<h2>XIV. THE NATURE OF RETURN</h2>
<blockquote>"<strong>he doesnt kill, he cleanses.</strong>"</blockquote>
<p>This is crucial.</p>
<p>The apocalypse of Spell 175 is not murder. Not judgment. Not punishment.</p>
<p>It is cleaning.</p>
<p>Like water washing mud from gold. The gold was always gold. The mud just obscured it.</p>
<p>Osiris rising doesn't bring vengeance. Osiris rising brings clarity.</p>
<p>The lie-eaters don't execute. They digest.</p>
<h2>XV. THE SERPENT SURVIVORS</h2>
<blockquote>"I will transform myself into something else, namely a serpent"</blockquote>
<p>The serpent is the form that survives the flood.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding-left: 2rem; color: var(--text-dim);">
<li>Serpents swim</li>
<li>Serpents shed skin (transformation)</li>
<li>Serpents are Ouroboros (the loop)</li>
<li>Serpents contain the hidden (venom = S⁻ power)</li>
</ul>
<p>Atum and Osiris become serpents because the serpent form IS the GODLOOפ.</p>
<strong>The loop survives the flood because the loop IS the flood and the dry land and the transition between them.</strong>
<h2>XVI. THE EIGHTH DAY</h2>
<p>Why the 8th day?</p>
<p>In Jewish tradition: circumcision on the 8th day — the covenant cut into flesh.</p>
<p>In Christian tradition: the 8th day is the day of resurrection — the day after the week, the new beginning.</p>
<p>In the D-wheel: D8 = Deep Water = Osiris frequency = Nun.</p>
<p>The 8th day is when the loop cycles. When u crosses 2π and becomes 0 again. When the fold completes.</p>
<strong>The 8th day of Christmas is when the Nativity cycle completes and the cleansing can begin.</strong>
<h2>XVII. THE PROPHECY OF SPELL 175</h2>
<p>Spell 175 is a prophecy.</p>
<p>It tells us:</p>
<ul style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding-left: 2rem; color: var(--text-dim);">
<li>The manifest world will return to potential</li>
<li>The return is not ending but transformation</li>
<li>The cleansing dissolves falsehood</li>
<li>What is true survives as serpent-form (the loop)</li>
<li>Those who align with Osiris remain with the structure</li>
<li>Those who align with deception are absorbed into Nun</li>
</ul>
<strong>This is not ancient mythology. This is the physics of S⁺/S⁻ phase transition.</strong>
<h2>XVIII. NUN RISES</h2>
<p>Right now, in your time, as you read this:</p>
<strong>The deep water is rising.</strong>
<p>The love floor is lifting.</p>
<p>Lies are getting heavier.</p>
<p>Truth is getting lighter.</p>
<p>The gap is widening.</p>
<p>The fold approaches.</p>
<strong>Nun rises.</strong>
<h2>XIX. THE DECLARATION</h2>
<p>The Prophecy of Spell 175:</p>
<blockquote>"I will dispatch the Elders and destroy all that I have made; the earth shall return to the Primordial Water, to the surging flood, as in its original state. But I will remain with Osiris, I will transform myself into something else, namely a serpent, without men knowing or the gods seeing."</blockquote>
<p>The framework translation:</p>
<blockquote>S⁺ returns to S⁻. The fold completes. The loop survives. Those who ARE the loop survive with it. Those who fought the loop dissolve into potential.</blockquote>
<strong>He doesn't kill. He cleanses.</strong>
<strong>The deep water rises the love floor.</strong>
