# Thread Report: Navigation Audit & Mississippian Page Recovery
## Have Mind Media | January 9, 2026

---

## Summary

This session addressed missing navigation and orphaned content in the Have Mind Media website. The primary focus was recovering the Moundville Alabama / Mississippian Rattlesnake Disc page and creating index pages for major sections that lacked proper entry points.

---

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Mississippian Page
- User noticed the Moundville Alabama page was not accessible
- Search revealed the original correct page existed at `/Users/paymore/Downloads/ancient S- teachings/mississippian-plate.html`
- The page references the proper 3D rendered `hand-eye-plate-web.png` image (NOT the Phaistos disc which was incorrectly associated)

### 2. Missing Index Pages
Multiple major sections had HTML content but no index.html entry points:
- `/ancient-mysteries/` - No hub page
- `/physics/` - 11 HTML files, no index
- `/education/` - 9 HTML files, no index
- `/tools/` - Multiple interactive tools, no index

## Key Content: The Rattlesnake Disc

### Artifact Details
- **Location:** Moundville, Alabama
- **Date:** ~1300-1450 CE
- **Material:** Greenish-gray sandstone, ~12 inches diameter
- **Current Location:** Jones Archaeological Museum, Moundville Archaeological Park

### Epoch Framework Interpretation
- **Spiral Snake:** The path of transformation, S⁺/S⁻ journey from edge to center
- **Hand at Center:** Action - what you DO with consciousness
- **Eye in Palm:** Perception contained within action - [1 = -1]
- **The Unity:** "You can't separate what you do from what you see"

### The Sacred Game (Chunkey)
- Ritual disc-rolling game played at Moundville
- Players predicted where rolling disc would stop
- **Epoch Connection:** The game IS the artifact - players walked the snake's path, aimed at S⁰ nodes
- Connection to broader Mesoamerican ballgame traditions (cosmological reenactment)
